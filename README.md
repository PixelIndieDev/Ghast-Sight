# Ghast Sight
**Tired of ghasts ignoring you?**

This mod fixes that by giving ghasts an actually reasonable vertical line of sight. No more ghasts that ignore you because youâ€™re 5 blocks above them.

## Features
- Expands how far ghasts can spot you vertically | configurable through [mod menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).
- Compatible with vanilla Minecraft combat and AI | fire rates, movement, etc. remain untouched
- Dynamically updates in-game when the config is changed
